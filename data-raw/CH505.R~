#' Within-host longitudinal Env single-genome amplification alignment from CH505.
#'

#' An alignment of 384 + 2 full-length HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (env) gp160 
#' amino-acid sequences sampled from 4 (w004) through 160 (w160) weeks 
#' post-infection.  Twelve sequences have been excluded from this alignment, 
#' two with unique long insertions relative to the TF (w009.33. and w136.B1. ) and ten with 
#' deletions .  
#' These two sequences explain why so many gapped columns are unoccupied, i.e. the gaps are place-holders for the long insertions.

#' \describe{
#'   \item{sequence name}{Up to three dot-separated fields, indicating time post-infection, in weeks, the amplicon identifier, and the database accession number.  Two additional sequences are the HXB2 reference for numbering positions and the inferred transmitted-founder virus, which matches multiple Envs.}
#'   \item{sequence text}{Asparagines potential N-linked glycosylation sites are indicated as "O".  Gap characters ("-") are inserted to maintain aligned sites.  "Z" indicates a stop codon.  "X" indicates an incomplete or ambiguous codon.}
